HelpMom is an useful application for all women who are willing to communicate 
their feelings before and after pregnancy, to share ideas and beliefs about 
their babies and how to raise a child.

This application is meant to be a community that helps mothers to get in touch.


Here is the project map:

 1. First view: You have to write your username and password.
                If you don't have an account, you are invited to register.
                The user will receive via email the username and password.

 2. Our application provides several topics (menu) and the user can choose 
    among them.
    If the topic is not available, the user can come with another one.

 3. The user can publish a message and the others can answer in real-time.
